 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Jeremy's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  I've always been passionate about technology and programming from a very young age but decided to pursue medicine at UT Austin since it offered a structured and rewarding career path to help others in need. Fast forward to my Junior year, I just finished taking the MCAT and began filling out my Med School Applications where I came to the realization that if my goal was to make a positive impact on those around me today, then 8 more years of school isn't the right trajectory for me. Through my personal research about advancements in AI, Machine Learning, and Software rapidly revolutionizing industries across the board, I knew there was still a perfect opportunity for me to make a positive impact on others with technology! Since then, I've taken several courses and explored opportunities in Data Analytics, Data Science, Data Engineering, and ultimately fell in love with the world of Software Engineering. I'm eager to take my scientific research background and leverage my unique perspective to develop software products with the goal of delivering solutions that benefit the people around me through industries like Biotech, Healthcare, Tech, and AI!
